$mystring = "foo";


let's learn php! here's what you'll need to know to be able to write programs.

first, we need to learn about the basic types of information. these are called primitives. they are:

strings: these are like words, or sentances, and can be characters, numbers, and symbols. they are always surrounded by quotes. for example, "i am 8 years old!" is a string.

numbers: there are two types of numbers in PHP: integers and floats. integers are like `8` or `574389547389`. floats are like `3.1415926` or `7.5`.

booleans: these represent if something is true or false. they just look like `true` or `false`.

null: this represents nothingness. very zen.



you'd be amazed: with just these five primitives (integers and floats are counted separately), you have all the types of information you need to write really complex programs!


another important basic concept in php is keywords. these are special words that tell the language something to do. the first keyword you should know about is `echo`...

we'll see more keywords as we go.


data on its own isn't very useful. we need to be able to do things with that data. the way we do things is with functions. for example, there's a function that tells you how long a string is:

strlen("i love chocolate")
> 14

there's another function that tells you if a number is odd:

isOdd(6)
> false

notice that functions return other primitives. strlen returns an integer. isOdd retuns a boolean. 


most of programming isn't just using built-in php functions: it's creating your own. let's create our first function together here:

function gimmeFive() {
	return 5;
}

here's all the parts of a function: ...


introduce variables here!!! - show a name multiple times on a page.


sometimes we need collections of things. for example, maybe we need a list of unlucky numbers. to do this, we will use a function called array, that creates a collection of things:

$unluckyNumbers = array(13, 4, 7);

this creates an array of the unlucky numbers.

show looping.

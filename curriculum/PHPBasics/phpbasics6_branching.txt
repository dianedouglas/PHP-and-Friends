OK, that was tricky. But you did it! You're here aren't you? A lot of advanced programmers struggle with scope for a long time, but you're getting it under your belt early. If it still doesn't make sense in a couple days, go re-read it and it'll probably be easier the second time around.

Now our programs can start to come to life and think for themselves. We're going to teach them to make decisions by **branching**.

Our functions can't just go through life always capitalizing or reversing our strings. What if sometimes we want lowercase, and sometimes we don't? We have to explain that to a function. There are only three types of branching: if, switch and ternary. 

if statements:

Let's create a function that checks a user's age and prints out "You can drink!" if they are over 21, but prints out "No drinks for you!" if they are under 21. 

Our input is the user's age. So our declaration looks like this (follow along in a new file):

```
function checkAge($user_age){

}
```

There are 3 keywords used as building blocks in if statements: `if`, `elseif`, and `else`. For this problem, we only need `if` and `else`.  Here's what it looks like, read the comments on the right to see what each line is doing.

```
function checkAge($user_age){
	if ($user_age > 21){				//if the user's age is greater than 21...
		return "You can drink!";		//return this string
	}
	else {								//otherwise...
		return "No drinks for you!";	//return this string.
	}
}
echo " <br> Hi checkAge function! My name is Barbara, and I'm 25. <br>";
echo checkAge(25);
echo " <br> Hi checkAge function! My name is Jim, and I'm 52. <br>";
echo checkAge(52);
echo " <br> Hi checkAge function! My name is Tiny Tim, and I'm 12. <br>";
echo checkAge(12);
```

The output will be:

```
Hi checkAge function! My name is Barbara, and I'm 25. 
You can drink! 
Hi checkAge function! My name is Jim, and I'm 52. 
You can drink! 
Hi checkAge function! My name is Tiny Tim, and I'm 12. 
No drinks for you!
```

After the `if` keyword, the expression inside the parenthesis is evaluated. The expression used with an if statement must be what is called a **conditional**.  A conditional must evaluate to either `true` or `false`.  For example, our user is either over 21 or they aren't. Actually, this brings us to our fourth variable type called a **boolean**. It is just a very simple variable which is only allowed to have these two values: `true` or `false`. A conditional must evaluate to a boolean.

If the conditional is `true`, our user is over 21, then the code between the first set of curly brackets next to the `if` conditional is run. If we get `false` and our user is under 21, then the code in the curly brackets after the `else` keyword is run instead. We have talked about `integer`s, `float`s, and `strings`, now we can add `boolean`s to our collection of primitives.

What if we want to display the message "You must still be really excited about drinking!" to a user who's 21? Luckily the keywords `if` and `else` have a friend called `elseif`. It lets you define an alternate condition to look for, and it is structured just like `if`. So we can change our function to look like this:

```
function checkAge($user_age){
	if ($user_age > 21){				//if the user's age is greater than 21...
		return "You can drink!";		//return this string
	}
	elseif ($user_age == 21){			//if the user's age is not greater than 21 but it is equal to 21...
		return "You must still be really excited about drinking!"		
	else {								//otherwise...
		return "No drinks for you!";	//return this string.
	}
}
echo " <br> Hi checkAge function! My name is Sam, and I'm 21. <br>";
echo checkAge(25);

```
The expression after `if` in the parenthesis is evaluated to `true` or `false`. If it is `true`, the code in its brackets is triggered. If it is false, then the expression after `elseif` is evaluated. If that one is true, (the user is exactly 21), then the code in the next set of curly brackets is run. You can have as many `elseif` conditions as you want, but only one `if` condition, and it has to come first. If none of the `if` or `elseif` conditions evaluate to true, then the code in the curly brackets following the `else` keyword is run.

ternary:

A ternary expression looks weird because it involves a `?` and a `:`. But really it could be rewritten as an if-else statement. It's just shorter if your condition is very simple and the code is very short. It looks like this:

```
	$fuel < 1 ? "there is not enough fuel." : "there is totally enough fuel.";
```
The ternary starts with a condition to evaluate immediately to the left of a `?`. This is immediately followed by what should happen if the condition is true. This must be only one line long. Then, to show the end of that line there is a `:`. To the right of the colon is the instruction to follow if the condition is false. Then don't forget to end the line with a semicolon.

They don't show up too often, but these are good for testing if a variable is set before passing it to a function, or assigning the larger of two values to a variable.  Here are a couple more examples: 

```
	$x = 1; //set x equal to 1 and y to 0.
	$y = 0;
	$save_larger = $x > $y ? $x : $y; //put either $x or $y into the variable $save_larger based on which one is larger.
	echo "$save_larger <br>";
	$y = 10;
	$save_larger = $x > $y ? $x : $y;
	echo $save_larger;
```

`switch`:

A switch is like an if statement with several elseifs, except that instead of having a condition for each elsif, there is only one expression to decide which code to run. The switch expression doesn't have to evaluate to `true` or `false` like the expressions used with `if` and `elseif`. It could have many possible answers, which we call cases. 

If statements are the most common form of branching, but if you have too many elseifs, it's might be time to consider a switch. A switch is like a menu system, where a single string decides which course of action to take: "save", "open", "close" etc. 

```
	$menu_choice = "Close";
	switch ($menu_choice)
	{
		case "Save":
			echo "Save the file.";
			break;
		case "Open...":
			echo "Open the file selection dialog.";
			break;
		case "Close":
			echo "Quit the program.";
			break;
	}
```

In a real program, all the echo statements above could be function calls to do more complex things. 

When writing a switch statement, start with the keyword `switch`, followed by the deciding expression in parenthesis.  Then add curly braces for your cases (possible outcomes of the expression). 

Inside of the curly braces, indent and write the keyword `case` followed by the outcome you want to look for first. Then instead of curly brackets, use `:` and `break;` to begin and end the block of code to execute for each possible outcome. Then add the code that you want to trigger for each case, indented again.

An important note: without `break;`, all of the code after the first case which passes run, up until the next break statement, regardless of if the subsequent cases are true or not. 

For example:

```
$menu_choice = "Save";
switch ($menu_choice)
{
	case "Save":
		echo "Save the file. <br>";
	case "Open...":
		echo "Open the file selection dialog. <br>";
	case "Close":
		echo "Quit the program. <br>";
}
```

This will run all three blocks of code because the first one is true. The output will be:

```
Save the file.
Open the file selection dialog.
Quit the program.
```
Lastly, it's also a good idea to include a default case for times when none of the case conditions are met. This is just like an `else` condition. `default` doesn't need a break after it if it's at the end of the switch (which is the normal place to put it).

```
$menu_choice = "I don't want to choose!";
switch ($menu_choice)
{
	case "Save":
		echo "Save the file.";
		break;
	case "Open...":
		echo "Open the file selection dialog.";
		break;
	case "Close":
		echo "Quit the program.";
		break;
	default: 
		echo "What are you doing Dave?";
} 
```

Let's talk some more about those boolean conditions used in if statements. 

They are created using a short list of pretty self-explanatory operators. Here are some you have probably seen before in math class:

```
2 > 1 	//evaluates to true. is 2 greater than 1? yes.
1 >= 1 	//evaluates to true. is 1 greater than or equal to 1? yes.
2 < 1 	//evaluates to false. is 2 less than 1? no.
1 <= 1 	//evaluates to true. is 1 less than or equal to 1? yes, it is equal.
2 == 1	//evaluates to false. is 2 equal to 1? no it is not, so false.
```

So in your conditions you can have `>` greater than, `>=` greater than or equal to, `<` less than, `<=` less than or equal to, or `==` equal to. These are generally used to compare numbers.

Any function(s) that returns true or false can be called inside the parenthesis for your condition.

Boolean conditions and functions can be chained using **logical operators**. These include `&&`, which means 'and', `||`, which means 'or', and '!' which means 'not'.

//mention being careful of = vs ==
//mention testing for falseness, and the concept of null.

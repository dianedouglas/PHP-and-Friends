PHP Quickstart

Give your files the .php extension to give them access to the whole PHP language.
When this file is read by the server, which is the master chef, you can telll him that you are using php code by using these opening and closing tags 

<?php         ?>

Everything outside of those tags is sent to your browser as HTML.

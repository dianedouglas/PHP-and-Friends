Download the php archive file:
https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar

In terminal, change directory into your downloads folder so that you are in the same location as the downloaded file.

cd ~/Downloads
chmod +x phpunit.phar
sudo mv phpunit.phar /usr/local/bin/phpunit
phpunit --version

this last command will give you the PHPUnit version if it was installed correctly.
